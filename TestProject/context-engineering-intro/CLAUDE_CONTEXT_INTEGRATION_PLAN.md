## Archon Project Management Integration

### Task Status Tracking
```yaml
Archon Tasks Flow:
  1. Primary Task: "Integrate Claude Context MCP Server" (todo)
  2. Environment Setup (todo → doing → review → done)
  3. MCP Installation (todo → doing → review → done)  
  4. Codebase Indexing (todo → doing → review → done)
  5. Pipeline Integration (todo → doing → review → done)
  6. Testing & Validation (todo → doing → review → done)
  7. Documentation (todo → doing → review → done)
```

### Archon RAG Integration
When creating tasks, use Archon's RAG capabilities to:
- Search for similar integration patterns
- Find code examples from knowledge base
- Reference best practices for MCP server integration
- Access historical project decisions

### Context Sharing Protocol
```yaml
Between Archon and Claude Context:
  1. Archon creates task with code context requirement
  2. Claude Context searches for relevant code patterns  
  3. Archon updates task with semantic search results
  4. Implementation agent receives enhanced context
  5. Results feed back to Archon for completion tracking
```

## Implementation Commands

### Archon Task Creation
```python
# To be executed via Archon MCP tools
mcp__archon__manage_task(
  action="create",
  project_id="6d0d8ce0-d80d-4132-8c26-2845a61518b8",
  title="Integrate Claude Context MCP Server into Pipeline",
  description="[Full description from Primary Archon Task above]",
  assignee="master-orchestrator", 
  status="todo",
  task_order=100,
  feature="claude-context-integration"
)
```

### Progress Tracking
Regular status updates through Archon:
```python
# Update task status as work progresses
mcp__archon__manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="[generated_task_id]",
  update_fields={
    "status": "doing",
    "description": "[updated with progress notes]"
  }
)
```

This integration plan ensures Claude Context is properly integrated into the MCP pipeline while maintaining full project management visibility through the Archon system.
